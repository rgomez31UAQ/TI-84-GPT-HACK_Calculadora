## About

This project turns your dusty graphing calculator into a WiFi-enabled device capable of querying ChatGPT and downloading programs over the air.

The original concept came from ChromaLock, who made a [video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bicjxl4EcJg) back in 2024. His repo got nuked, so I rebuilt the whole thing from scratch based on what I could piece together. Most of the code, PCB design, and implementation is my own work at this point.

## Features

- ChatGPT integration - ask questions directly from your calculator, with **loop mode** to keep asking without returning to menu
- **Calculus solver** - derivatives, integrals, double integrals, average value, general math solver, and infinite series convergence
- **Physics solver** - elastic and inelastic collision calculations
- **Utilities** - translate text and define words
- Wi-Fi connectivity via ESP32 with **captive portal configuration**
- **WiFi scanner** - scan for nearby networks and connect directly from the calculator
- **WPA2-Enterprise (eduroam)** - connect to university/enterprise WiFi networks via the captive portal
- **MAC address spoofing** - view and change the ESP32's MAC address
- **Smart case input** - letters default to lowercase; wrap in parentheses for uppercase, e.g. `A(B)CD` becomes `aBcd`
- Program downloads over the air
- Image display support (96x63 monochrome)
- **OTA updates** - update both ESP32 firmware and calculator program wirelessly
- **Deep sleep** - ESP32 sleeps after 2 minutes of inactivity to save battery, wakes instantly when the calculator sends a command
- **Pre-configured server** - no need to run your own!

## How It Works

The TI-84 has a 2.5mm link port originally designed for calculator-to-calculator communication using Texas Instruments' proprietary link protocol. This mod exploits that by wiring an ESP32 microcontroller to impersonate another calculator.

When your calculator sends a variable (like a command number), the ESP32 intercepts it using the CBL2 library, which reverse-engineers TI's protocol. The ESP32 then performs the actual work (WiFi requests, API calls, etc.) and sends the results back as calculator variables (strings, numbers, or even pictures).

The TI-BASIC launcher program on your calculator provides the UI - it sends commands to the ESP32, waits for responses, and displays the results. From the calculator's perspective, it's just talking to another calculator. It has no idea there's WiFi involved.

## Building One

I'm intentionally leaving out a detailed hardware tutorial. If you know enough to build one, you probably don't need step-by-step instructions. If you don't, this isn't the project to learn on. This also keeps people from easily mass-producing these to cheat on exams.

The schematic and PCB files are in the repo if you want to figure it out yourself.

## Software Setup

### 1. ESP32 Setup
1. Open `/esp32/esp32.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Install required libraries: TICL, CBL2, TIVar, WiFi, HTTPClient, UrlEncode, Preferences
3. Flash the code to your ESP32
4. No configuration files needed!

### 2. WiFi Configuration (Captive Portal)
1. Power on your calculator and run the **ANDYGPT** program
2. Go to **Settings → SETUP** to broadcast the captive portal
3. On your phone/computer, connect to the WiFi network named **"calc"**
4. A captive portal will automatically open (or navigate to `192.168.4.1`)
5. Enter your WiFi name and password
6. Click "Save & Connect"
7. The ESP32 will remember the settings for next time

The server is pre-configured to use my hosted instance - no need to run your own!

### 3. Calculator Setup
Transfer the **ANDYGPT** program to your calculator using Settings → Update in the launcher, or by connecting via USB.

## Running Your Own Server (Optional)

By default, the ESP32 connects to my hosted server. If you want to run your own:

1. Set up the server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. Create `server/.env` and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node index.mjs
   ```

4. Expose it with ngrok or similar:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8080
   ```

5. Change the server URL in `/esp32/esp32.ino` - find the `SERVER` define and update it to your ngrok URL.

## Reconfiguring WiFi

If you need to change WiFi settings:
- Go to **Settings → MORE → SETUP** in the ANDYGPT program to broadcast the captive portal
- Or use **Settings → SCAN WIFI** to scan for nearby networks and connect directly
- Or erase ESP32 flash and re-upload the firmware

## Connecting to Eduroam (University WiFi)

1. Go to **Settings → MORE → SETUP** to open the captive portal
2. Connect to the **"calc"** WiFi from your phone/computer
3. Open `192.168.4.1` if the portal doesn't auto-open
4. Click the **Eduroam** tab
5. Enter your university email and password
6. Click "Connect to Eduroam"

## Case-Sensitive Input

The TI-84 keyboard only types uppercase letters. To enter lowercase or mixed-case text (e.g. WiFi passwords):

- All letters are **lowercase by default**
- Wrap a letter in parentheses to make it **uppercase**: `(H)ELLO` → `Hello`
- Numbers and symbols are unchanged: `PASSWORD123!` → `password123!`

## Using GPT

1. From the main menu, select **GPT**
2. Type your question and press ENTER
3. Wait for the response to appear
4. Press **any key** to ask another question, or **CLEAR** to return to the menu

The GPT mode loops so you can have a continuous conversation without navigating back to the menu each time.

**Note:** Use plain text for math questions (e.g., "integrate x squared from 0 to 1") rather than calculator symbols like ∫(. The TI-84's special math tokens aren't fully decoded yet.

## Using Math

1. From the main menu, select **MATH**
2. Choose **DERIVATIVE**, **INTEGRAL**, **DOUBLE INT**, **SERIES**, **AVG VALUE**, or **SOLVER**
3. Enter your function:
   - For derivatives/integrals: use X as the variable (e.g., `X^2`, `sin(X)`)
   - For double integrals: enter F(X,Y), Y bounds, and X bounds when prompted
   - For average value: enter F(X,Y) and the region bounds
   - For solver: type any math problem in plain text
   - For series: use N as the variable (e.g., `1/N^2`, `1/2^N`)
4. The result appears instantly
5. Press **any key** for another calculation, **CLEAR** to go back

**Examples:**
- Derivative of `X^3` → `3 X^2`
- Integral of `X^2` → `1/3 X^3 + C`
- Double integral of `X*Y` with Y=0..1, X=0..2
- Average value of `X*Y` over rectangle [0,4] x [0,3]
- Solver: `evaluate integral 0 to 1 of integral 0 to 1-x of x+y dy dx`
- Series `1/N^2` → converges (pi^2/6)

## Using Physics

1. From the main menu, select **PHYSICS**
2. Choose **ELASTIC** or **INELASTIC**
3. Enter values as: `M1,V1,M2,V2` (masses and velocities)
4. The result shows the final velocities
5. Press **any key** for another calculation, **CLEAR** to go back

## OTA Updates

Both the ESP32 firmware and the calculator launcher program can be updated over-the-air:

1. Go to **Settings → UPDATE** on your calculator
2. The ESP32 checks the server for a new version
3. If available, it flashes the new ESP32 firmware and reboots
4. After reboot, the updated launcher program is automatically pushed to your calculator

To check your current version and the latest available, go to **Settings → VERSION**.


## Troubleshooting

- **ESP32 not responding:** Check your TIP/RING connections. They might be swapped.
- **WiFi won't connect:** Make sure you're connecting to a 2.4GHz network. The ESP32-C3 doesn't support 5GHz.
- **ChatGPT returns garbage:** The response might contain characters the calculator can't display. Working on it.
- **Calculator freezes:** The link protocol is timing-sensitive. Try again, or power cycle both devices.

## Planned Features

- Multi-page GPT responses
- Basic web browsing
- Camera support (ESP32-S3)

## Known Issues

- Images don't work consistently
- **Complex math expressions** (integrals, derivatives, summations) use TI tokens that aren't decoded yet - type questions as plain text instead of using math symbols
