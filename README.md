## Setup

### 1. Server Setup

The server runs on port 8080 by default. Use ngrok or similar to expose it:
```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

### 2. ESP32 Setup
1. Flash the code in `/esp32` to your ESP32
2. **No need to edit any config files!**

### 3. WiFi Configuration (Captive Portal)
1. Power on the ESP32
2. Connect to the WiFi network named **"calc"** from your phone/computer
3. A captive portal will automatically open (or navigate to `192.168.4.1`)
4. Enter your settings:
   - **Hotspot Name (SSID):** Your phone's hotspot or home WiFi name
   - **Hotspot Password:** Your WiFi password
   - **Server URL:** Your ngrok URL (e.g., `https://xxx.ngrok-free.app`)
   - **Chat Name:** Your display name in chat (optional)
5. Click "Save & Connect"
6. The ESP32 will connect to your network and remember the settings

### 4. Calculator Setup
Transfer the LAUNCHER program to your calculator using the TI-32 menu.

## Reconfiguring WiFi

If you need to change WiFi settings:
- **Method 1:** The captive portal is available for a few seconds on every boot
